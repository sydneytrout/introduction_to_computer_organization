 After gaining a large amount of experience working with ppm files in project
 one, this project was definitely easier. We already knew how to properly
 handle things such as header data and reading in data from an input file in C.
 The only major error we experienced in this project was an issue that
 stemmed from using multiple files. We spent quite a bit of time trying to
 properly arrange our functions within the files so that it would properly
 compile. After dealing with this issue, everything else was quite simple.
 The only other time consuming portion of the project was creating a nice
 image to submit to the competition part of this project, which was actually
 super fun. This project was a great way to show off our knowledge of ppm
 files that we had learned from project one. It was also a way to incorporate
 knowledge of linked lists that we had from prior computer science classes at
 Clemson. This project was overall super rewarding, as we were able to produce
 a beautiful ppm image from material we had learned throughout the semester.
